_Okay, now I want to upgrade my todo apps_. Let's say I want to create a profile page and display whatever name I input into my todo pages. How to make my pages communicate each other? _Redux is one solution!_. Treats use Redux for its global state management. You may need to learn about [Redux Concept][Redux], before proceeding into this tutorial.

To use Redux in Treats projects, you don't need to add `Provider` and creating store for your app, because Treats will handle it for you. Simply you just need to connect your component to Redux, define your reducer, and combine it under `_redux` [filesystem hooks][filesystem-hooks].

Enough with the chatter, let's put our hands to it.

## Creating Redux Action, Types, and Initial State
1. Create your profile page. Create `profile` folder under page. You may use Treats [generator][generator].
```
/* src/page/profile.js */

import React, { Component } from "react";
import { injectIntl } from "@treats/intl";

import { connect } from "@treats/redux";
import style from "./profile.css";

/**
*  Profile Page for Treats Tutorial
* @param props React props
* @param props.name
* 
*/
class Profile extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            name: ""
        }
    }

    handleFormSubmit = e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const { name } = this.state;

        //Save your component to Redux
    }

    handleInputChange = e => {
        this.setState({
            name: e.target.value
        })
    }

    render() {
        const { intl, name } = this.props,
            { name: temporaryName } = this.state;
        return(
            <div>
                <h3>Hello, {name}</h3>

                <form onSubmit={this.handleFormSubmit}>
                    <input value={temporaryName} onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
                    <button>{intl.formatMessage({id: "submit"})}</button>
                </form>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    /** YOUR MAP STATE TO PROPS FUNCTION */
});
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    /** YOUR MAP DISPATCH TO PROPS FUNCTION */
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(injectIntl(Profile));
```

But where can I get the `name` props? Good question! We will get the `name` props from Redux state, and that's what `mapStateToProps` for. But we will implement it later, after creating our action and reducers.

2. Create Redux boilerplate for profile. You can use Treats [generator][generator]. For this tutorial, we will create it under `./src/redux` and follow the Treats Redux boilerplate generator structures.
```
src
|-- ...
|-- page
|-- redux
    |-- profile
        |-- action.js
        |-- index.js
        |-- initial-state.js
        |-- reducer.js
        |-- type.js
```
```
/* src/redux/profile/index.js */

import profileReducer from "./reducer";

export { default as profileActions } from "./action";
export { default as profileTypes } from "./type";
export { default as profileInitialState } from "./initial-state";

export default profileReducer;
```

3. Add Redux action type definition in `type.js`.
```
/* src/redux/profile/type.js */
const types = {
    /* Some other types */,
    UPDATE_NAME: "UPDATE_NAME"
};

export default types;
```

4. Implement our action to `action.js`. __Note:__ If you use generator, there will be `setInitialStateprofile` action. You don't need to delete it.
```
/* src/redux/profile/action.js */

import types from "./type";

/* Some other actions */

const updateName = name => ({
  type: types[UPDATE_NAME],
  name
})

export default {
    /* Some other actions */,
    updateName
};
```

5. Add action handler in `reducer.js`
```
/* src/redux/profile/reducer.js */

import initialState from "./initial-state";
import types from "./type";

const profileActionHandlers = {
    /* Some other reducers */,
    [types.UPDATE_NAME]: (state, action) => ({
        ...state,
        name: action.name
    })
};

const profileReducer = (state = initialState, action) =>
    profileActionHandlers[action.type] ? profileActionHandlers[action.type](state, action) : state;

export default profileReducer;
```

6. We may just need a proper initial state, so let's add some initial state in `initial-state.js`.
```
/* src/redux/profile/initial-state.js */

const initialState = {
    /* Some other states */,
    name: "User"
};

export default initialState;
```

7. Alright all set in our Redux part. But we're not done yet. Let's continue into the next section.

## Tweaking The Filesystem Hooks
Treats provide filesystem hooks for easy custom configuration and Redux is included inside it. We already create our reducers for profile page. But the whole app only need a single reducer, since Treats only have a single store. Fortunately, there's some helpful method called `combineReducers` and Treats already wrap it in its dependencies.

1. Create folder `_redux` under `src` and create `index.js` inside it.
```
src
|-- ...
|-- _redux
    |-- reducer.js
```

2. Write your `reducer.js` file
```
/* src/_redux/reducer.js */

import { combineReducers } from "@treats/redux";
/* Other reducer */
import ProfileReducer from "../redux/profile";

export default combineReducers({
    /* Other reducer */
    profile: ProfileReducer
});
```

3. All set for filesystem hooks, now let's get back to our unfinished components.

## `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`
Okay in the first section, we promise to implement our `mapStateToProps`. Here we are:

1. Implement our `mapStateToProps` in `profile.js`
```
/* src/page/profile/profile.js */

...

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    name: state.profile.name
});

```

2. Realize that our submit button doesn't do anything? Since we will push our new name to Redux, we are gonna dispatch `updateName` we create earlier. Here, `mapDispatchToProps` will come handy.
```
/* src/page/profile/profile.js */

/* Other import */
import { profileActions } from "../../redux/profile";

class Profile extends Component {
    
    handleFormSubmit = e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const { name } = this.state,
            { onFormSubmit } = this.props;

        //Save your component to Redux

        if (onFormSubmit) {
            onFormSubmit(name);
        }
    }

    /* Other class method */
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    name: state.profile.name
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    onFormSubmit: name => {
        dispatch(profileActions.updateName(name))
    }
});
```

3. All set to our components! Now check your redux page

## Registering Page To Routes
_Feels something missing? You're sharp!_. We need to register it to our route before testing it. Just like the previous tutorial, you need to add it in `path.js`, `route.js`, and `module.js` under `_route`.

1. Add profile route name to `path.js`. The route is up to you, but we will try with `/profile` for this tutorial
```
/* src/_route/path.js */

export const TODO = "/";
export const PROFILE = "/profile";
```

2. Add your route config in `route.js`. Also delete `disabled: true` in todo config, since it will trigger redirect. Redirect will cause Redux state back to initial state.
```
import { TODO, PROFILE } from "./path";

const route = [
    {
        name: "todo",
        path: TODO,
        exact: true
    },
    {
        name: "profile",
        path: PROFILE,
        exact: true,
    }
];

export default route;
```

3. Connect your path and your page in `module.js`
```
import Todo from "@page/todo";
import Profile from "@page/profile";

import { TODO, PROFILE } from "./path";

const module = {
    [TODO]: Todo,
    [PROFILE]: Profile
};

export default module;
```

4. Next, let's add some navigation button that connect our pages. __Note:__ please use `Link` instead of `<a>` tag, because Redux state will be reset to initial state when we redirect using `<a>` tag. This also explain why we need to remove `disabled: true` in todo route config.
```
/* src/page/todo/todo.js */

/* Other import */
import Link from "@treats/component/link";

class Todo extends Component {
    /* Other method */

    render() {
        const { keyword, items } = this.state,
            { intl } = this.props;
        return (
            <div className={style.todo_form}>
                <Link href="/profile" isPush>Change Name</Link>
                <br />
                <FormattedMessage
                    id="todo_title" 
                    values={{
                        name: "User",
                        value2: 20
                    }}
                />
                ...
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

```
/* src/page/profile/profile.js */

/* Other import */
import Link from "@treats/component/link";

class Profile extends Component {
    /* Other method */

    render() {
        const { name } = this.props,
            { name: temporaryName } = this.state;
        return(
            <div>
                ...
                <Link href="/" isPush>Back to Todo</Link>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

5. To show the name in `todo.js`, we need to connect `todo.js` with Redux. Connect it with `mapStateToProps` only since todo page will not be able to dispatch something to Redux store. By connecting todo component, todo component will have `name` in its props. We can access this props directly.
```
/* src/page/todo/todo.js */

class Todo extends Component {
    ...

    render() {
        const { keyword, items } = this.state,
            { intl, name } = this.props;
        return (
            <div className={style.todo_form}>
                <Link href="/profile" isPush>Change Name</Link>
                <br />
                <FormattedMessage
                    id="todo_title" 
                    values={{
                        name: name,
                        value2: 20
                    }}
                />
                ...
            </div>
        )
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    name: state.profile.name
})

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(injectIntl(Todo));
```
Now, the name on title will be changed after you change your name in profile page.
